# Yu-Gutnisky-2016
This project presents a DataJoint pipeline design for the data accompanying the paper
> Jianing Yu, Diego A Gutnisky, S Andrew Hires & Karel Svoboda1. "Layer 4 fast-spiking interneurons filter thalamocortical signals during active somatosensation" (2016) Nat Neurosci

https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nn.4412

The data are available from CRCNS: http://crcns.org/data-sets/ssc/ssc-7

## Design DataJoint data pipeline 
This repository will contain the Python 3+ code of the DataJoint data pipeline design for this dataset, as well as scripts for data ingestions and visualization

## Conversion to NWB 2.0
This repository will contain the Python 3+ code to convert the DataJoint pipeline into NWB 2.0 format (See https://neurodatawithoutborders.github.io/)
